Regroup a TRK 2-34 file such that all common record types are together. If
you have a file with SFDUs that are in the following order:

   01, 00, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 01, 00, 16

This program will reorder them in:

  00, 00, 01, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 16

Options::

   -v, verbose mode: display what is being done
   -p, prompt before writing file
   -h, access program help via the command line
   --validate, validate the output file by comparing it to the input file
